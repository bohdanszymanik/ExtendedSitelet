Playing with WebSharper.

Learning how server side HTML combinators are different from client side - I must be missing something here but this seems to 
make setting css attributes more difficult for server side.

Learning how to create webcontrols.

Learning how to use the templating feature. Think I'm still doing this a bit clumsily when dealing with multiple data-replace(ments).

Figuring out the workflow from template design to code - slowly getting there.
